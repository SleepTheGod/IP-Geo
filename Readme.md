This PowerShell script defines a function called whois that performs an IP lookup and geolocation by utilizing the ipinfo.io API. The function takes an IP address as an argument. It constructs a URL using the provided IP address, sends an HTTP request to ipinfo.io, and retrieves the JSON response. If the response contains information, it displays details such as the IP address, location (city, region, country), ISP, hostname, postal code, and any other desired fields from the response. However, if no information is available for the given IP, it shows a message stating "No information available for this IP." The script also includes parameter parsing to ensure an IP address is provided when executing the script, and it calls the whois function with the supplied IP address for lookup.
